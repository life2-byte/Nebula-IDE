# 🌌 Nebula IDE

> *The last IDE you'll ever need.*

Nebula is an AI-native development environment built from the ground up for the way modern developers actually work — fast, autonomous, and without friction. While other editors bolt AI on as an afterthought, Nebula was designed with intelligence at its core.

**Stop writing code. Start describing it.**

## ⚡ Why Nebula?

Every IDE today does the same thing — syntax highlighting, file trees, a terminal. Nebula does all of that. Then it goes further.

Nebula understands your entire project. It can rewrite it, restructure it, document it, and ship it to GitHub — all from a single instruction. No plugins. No configuration. No babysitting.

## 🚀 Core Features

**AI Code Engine**
Describe a change in plain English. Nebula's AI reads every file in your project, understands the context, and makes surgical updates across your entire codebase. Not just one file — the whole thing.

**One-Command GitHub Deploy**
Type one command. Nebula handles the commit message, the push, and the remote setup. Your code is live before you finish your coffee.

**Instant Git Initialization**
Open any folder. Tell Nebula to set it up. It creates the `.git` folder, writes a production-grade `.gitignore` for your stack, and generates a README — automatically. Zero config.

**Monaco-Powered Editor**
The same editor that powers VS Code. Full syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and multi-language support — running natively inside Nebula.

**Integrated Terminal**
A full xterm.js terminal, multi-tab, right inside your workspace. No switching windows.
